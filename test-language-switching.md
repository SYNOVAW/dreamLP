# Language Switching Bug Fixes - Testing Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **localStorage Key Mismatch** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: `useLocale.ts` used `'dreamlife-locale'` while `useClientLocale.ts` used `'remia-locale'`
- **Solution**: Standardized both to use `'dreamlife-locale'`
- **Impact**: Language preferences now persist correctly between sessions

### 2. **Unsafe Translation Access** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Direct access to `translations[locale]` could cause undefined errors during switching
- **Solution**: Added `createSafeTranslation` proxy with fallback handling
- **Impact**: No more undefined errors when accessing translation keys during language switches

### 3. **Loading States & Error Handling** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: No feedback during language switching, potential race conditions
- **Solution**: Added loading states, error handling, and graceful fallbacks
- **Impact**: Smooth user experience with loading indicators and error recovery

## Files Modified

1. `/hooks/use-client-locale.ts` - Main fixes applied
2. `/components/locale-provider.tsx` - Added loading overlay
3. `/components/language-switcher.tsx` - Updated to handle async setLocale

## Testing Instructions

1. Open http://localhost:3003
2. Try switching between languages (中文, 日本語, English)
3. Check that:
   - Language switches smoothly without errors
   - Loading indicator appears briefly during switches
   - Language preference persists on page refresh
   - No console errors during switching
   - All text content updates correctly

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

- ✅ Smooth language transitions
- ✅ Persistent language preferences
- ✅ Loading feedback during switches
- ✅ Error handling and recovery
- ✅ Fallback to default language if translation missing
- ✅ No console errors or undefined access issues
